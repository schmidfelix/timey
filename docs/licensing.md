# Licensing

Upon starting Timey the first time on a new computer, it will ask you for your license key. You can find that key on the
[product page](https://felix-schmid.de/product/timey) when you're logged in into your account.

## Manage your licenses

You can manage all your licenses inside [your account](https://felix-schmid.de/product/timey). There you can extend or
renew your license, buy additional ones and see the devices which are linked with your license.

You can open this page via the "Help" > "Manage your license" menu item.
