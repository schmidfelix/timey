# Statistics

The third page of the app is your statistics page. There you can see the tracked time, and your billable time for the
last 7 days in comparison with the previous 7 days.

If you have any suggestions for data to show up there, please create a
ticket [here](https://github.com/schmidfelix/timey/issues).
