# Tasks

You can create and assign tasks to projects. While projects are used to separate whole projects, tasks are used to
separate the different tasks inside your project. A little example:

The project could be `Website for my client`. Then you could have the tasks `Frontend`, `Backend` and `Documentation`.
Your tracked time will be associated with one of these tasks.

## Creating a task

To create a task, right click the header of your project and select "Create task"

![](/assets/docs/timey/v1/getting-started/create_task.png)

It will open a slideover where you can specify the task name, and the hourly rate used
for this task. By default, it will use the rate of the project.
