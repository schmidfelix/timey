# Projects

Timey is mainly divided into projects and task. To create your first projects go to the projects page and click the +
button in the upper right corner.

Otherwise you can just press `CommandOrControl + N` to create a new project from anywhere.

It will open a slideover asking for the name, a color, your hourly rate and the budget for the project.
